Cpros is a lightweight Ada command processor made by me, Reinert Korsnes.
It can facilitate tests of parts of a program during development, and it has
therefore been useful for me when doing complex programming. Cpros may
also be used permenently in programs (i.e. not only in the initial phase
of development). 

*Note: this release is to be considered experimental.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short version of instruction (for linux users):

Start (open) a terminal session/window ("$" here represents command prompt) :

Download the source file and make a file structure as for the version on github. 
Alternatively use git to clone:

$ git clone https://github.com/reinertk/cpros

This gives the directory "cpros" below your current directory. Enter cpros (i.e. "cd cpros").
Then enter (to produce the test program cpros_test1):

$ gprbuild -p

To start this test program, enter: 

$ ./cpros_test1

Now enter "do mac1" when prompted, and see what happens.
You must (so far) dig into the source code of cpros_test1 to figure out more if 
you want in practice to use this simple (but for me useful) tool. cpros_test1-adb
can function as a template for building you own program using cpros. 
However, the file "cpros_info.txt" (hopefully) provides some helpful introduction.

My best wishes to all,

Change log:
Sep 25, 2017 : Started to try to load up to github (as novice user of git and github - head on block).
Sep 27, 2017 : Update to ease use of code (system still in initial phase). Credit to
               contributors on google group comp.lang.ada to make me hurry up trying 
               to improve.
Sep 28, 2017 : Made some improvements to ease code readaing and made CTRL+d also serve as "exit" from terminal.
June 2, 2020 : Major revision
