cpros is a lightweight Ada command processor made by me, Reinert Korsnes.
It can facilitate tests of parts of a program during development, and it has
therefore been useful for me when doing complex programming.

*Note: this release is to be considered experimental.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Short version of instruction (for linux users):

Start (open) a terminal session/window ("$" here represents command prompt) :

Download the source file and make a file structure as for the version on github. 
Alternatively use git to clone:

$ git clone https://github.com/reinertk/cpros

This gives the directory "cpros" below your current directory. Enter cpros (i.e. "cd cpros").
Make sub-directory "obj":

$ mkdir obj

Then enter (to produce the test program cpros_test1):

$ gprbuild

To start this test program, enter: 

$ ./cpros_test1

Now enter "do mac1" when prompted, and see what happens.
You must (so far) dig into the source code of cpros_test1 to figure out more if 
you want in practice to use this simple (but for me useful) tool.
However, the file "cpros_info.txt" (hopefully) provides some helpful introduction.

My best wishes to all,

Change log:
Sep 25, 2017 : Started to try to load up to github (as novice user of git and github - head on block).
Sep 27, 2017 : Update to ease use of code (system still in initial phase). Credit to
               contributors on google group comp.lang.ada to make me hurry up trying 
               to improve.
