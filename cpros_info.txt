           cpros (Command Processor) 
           -------------------------

What it is:
-----------
cpros is a light-weight tool to help develop Ada programs. Its intention is to support quick prototyping 
and separate/modular tests of parts of programs. More especially, it is a tool for processing commands 
which one may enter directly to a program from terminal or via files (line by line). It is made with 
inspiration from computer os "shells" (such as unix shells). A command has the common format:

commad_name [arguments] ....

The special command, "do", is for invoking processing of commands in a file.
For example, the command:

do mac1

will start processing the commands in the file "mac1". The file "mac1" may contain
the commad "do mac2" (where "mav2" is another file with commands) and which also may
contain a "do" command etc.

The "do" command may include up tp 9 arguments like this:

do file [arg1], [arg2],...

For example, the command:

do mac1 Hello World

passes the arguments "Hello" and "World" to the command file mac1.
mac1 should in this case contain "$1" and "$2" which cpros replaces respectively by "Hello" and "World"
(this is quite similar to for example bash scripts).

cpros_test1.adb : Simple demo may serve as a template for using cpros.
                  Not here that an enumeration type "c_t" represents command names to 
                  facilitate use of the Ada case statement:
                  
                  case command is
                     when .. =>
                     when .. =>
                  end case; 

                  This can ensure that no commands are left out for further processing.
                  Storing commands in a variable of enumeration type, also facilitate 
                  compact and readable code (hopefully).

cpros.ads       : (generic) package for procedure for (only) procedure cprosa which
                  if intended to call a procedure provided by the user (programmer using cpros).
                  In the template "cpros_test1.adb" it is called "cpros_actual1".
 
split_string.ads : is for string handling (splitting a string into "atoms" separated by space or comma ",".
